8.  renamed images for better readiability 
"Changing the image filename from 'title.png' to 'go-mikes-designs.png' provides more context about the image's content to both users and search engines. The new filename accurately reflects that the image is the logo for 'Go Mike's Designs'. This makes it easier for search engines to understand the image's relevance to the site, potentially improving SEO. It also provides a better user experience, as people can get a sense of what the image might be even if they can't see it (for instance, if the image fails to load or if they're using a screen reader).
